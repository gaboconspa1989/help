When dealing with leaky pipes or minor plumbing issues, **Plumbing Repair Tape from Home Depot** offers a quick and reliable temporary fix. This durable, self-fusing silicone tape bonds securely to create a watertight seal, saving you from costly emergency calls. The price depends on tape width, length, and brand, ranging from $8 to $20.  

**Steps to apply:**  
1. Clean and dry the pipe surface thoroughly.  
2. Stretch the tape slightly while wrapping it tightly around the leak.  
3. Overlap each layer by half for a secure seal.  

Ideal for quick repairs, but for long-term solutions, consulting a professional plumber ensures lasting results. Keep a roll handy for unexpected leaks!
